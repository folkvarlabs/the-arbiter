This document explains the automated processes, if applicable, related to the flash loan contracts in this repository.

The flash loan contracts in this repository are primarily intended for manual execution, as they are examples demonstrating how to request and execute flash loans on various DeFi platforms. However, you can implement custom logic within the contracts or create external scripts to automate specific tasks, such as monitoring for arbitrage opportunities or scheduling contract interactions.

Please note that automating the execution of flash loans can be complex and risky. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying DeFi platforms, smart contract development, and market dynamics. Always thoroughly test your automated strategies before deploying them to a mainnet.

To implement your own automated processes, you may consider the following:

1. Create custom scripts to monitor for potential arbitrage opportunities using APIs or Web3.
2. Use a decentralized automation platform, such as Gelato Network, to schedule and execute flash loan transactions.
3. Build custom on-chain logic within your flash loan contracts to automate specific actions.

Please be aware that this document does not provide a detailed guide on implementing automation. You will need to research and develop your own strategies based on your specific requirements and preferences.
